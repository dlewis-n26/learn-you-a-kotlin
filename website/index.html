      If you're a Java developer who hasn't yet made the leap to Kotlin, or have a Java codebase you would like to

  <div id="intro">
    <p>
      Working as a group, we'll take existing Java code, convert it to Kotlin in IntelliJ, and then refactor the
      results to idiomatic Kotlin. We'll see how to take advantage of the language to make code smaller, faster
      and more expressive, whilst at the same time interoperating with your existing application and Java
      libraries.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon we move from the prepared exercises to look at <em>your code</em>, working together to apply the
      techniques and insights from the morning to real codebases with real constraints. So if you have some code
      you'd like to start migrating, bring it along.

    <h2>The Presenters</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.natpryce.com/">Nat Pryce</a> co-authored the highly respected book,
      <span class="quote">Growing Object Software Guided by the Tests</span>.
      <a href="http://www.oneeyedmen.com">Duncan McGregor</a> didn’t, but manages to get by
      regardless. They have a combined 40 years of programming on the JVM, in applications ranging from real-time video
      processing to finance.</p>
    <p>Duncan and Nat adopted Kotlin while working together in 2015 and presented their experiences to the first London
      Kotlin Meetup. They then talked about
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-AOjgobGR8" class="quote">Expressive Kotlin</a> at
      JetBrains London Kotlin Night in 2016. Duncan presented
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExkNNsDn6Vg" class="quote">The Cost of Kotlin Language Features</a> at KotlinConf 2017,
      and Nat is presenting <span class="quote">Exploring the Kotlin type hierarchy from top to bottom</span> at
      KotlinConf 2018.

    <h2>Feedback from previous sessions</h2>
    <p>
      The workshop is based on sessions for the British Computer Society and SPA Conference in 2016 and the London
      Java Community in 2018.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Great intro to Kotlin, lots of crossover and functionality"</li>
      <li>"Good at highlighting what’s different about Kotlin compared to Java or Scala"</li>
      <li>"Love the energy and interaction with clear explanation"</li>
      <li>"The speakers were good at speaking. The talk itself was well thought out and a great introduction to
        Kotlin.
        It was obvious the guy knew his stuff with the answers he gave to questions. The ability to ask
        questions as we
        went on was very useful."
      </li>
      <li>"I liked the pair programming and live coding aspects of the event. It's really engaging."</li>
      <li>"It was very smoothly executed and good to have someone on keyboard with someone else talking so it
        flowed
        well."
      </li>
      <li>"The presentation was lively and full of personality."</li>

    <h2>Workshop Dates</h2>
    <h3 id="kotlinconf">3 October 2018</h3>
    <p>The workshop is being held as part of KotlinConf in Amsterdam.</p>
    <p>If you are already attending the conference, you can add the workshop to your conference pass.</p>
    <p>
      Now that the conference is full, we've negotiated with JetBrains to open a few places without a conference pass.
      If you'd like to come, please email

      and we can make arrangements.
