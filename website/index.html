            If you're a Java developer who hasn't yet made the leap to Kotlin, or have a Java codebase you would like to
            migrate, this one day workshop is for you.

    <div id="intro">
        <p>
            Working as a group, we'll take existing Java code, convert it to Kotlin in IntelliJ, and then refactor the
            results to idiomatic Kotlin. We'll see how to take advantage of the language to make code smaller, faster
            and more expressive, whilst at the same time interoperating with your existing application and Java
            libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the afternoon we move from the prepared exercises to look at your code, working together to apply the
            techniques and insights from the morning to real codebases with real constraints. So if you have some code
            you'd like to start migrating, bring it along.

        <h2>The Presenters</h2>
        <p>Nat Pryce co-authored the highly respected book, <span
                class="quote">Growing Object Software Guided by the Tests</span>. Duncan McGregor
            didn’t, but manages to get by regardless. They have a combined 40 years of programming on the JVM, in
            applications
            ranging from real-time video processing to finance.</p>
        <p>Duncan and Nat adopted Kotlin while working together in 2015 and presented their experiences to the first
            London
            Kotlin Meetup. They talked about <span class="quote">Expressive Kotlin</span> at JetBrains London Kotlin
            Night in
            2016. Duncan presented <span class="quote">The Cost of Kotlin Language Features</span> at KotlinConf 2017,
            and Nat
            is presenting <span class="quote">Exploring the Kotlin type hierarchy from top to bottom</span> at
            KotlinConf 2018.

        <p>
            The workshop is based on sessions for the British Computer Society and SPA Conference in 2016 and the London
            Java Community in 2018.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Great intro to Kotlin, lots of crossover and functionality"</li>
            <li>"Good at highlighting what’s different about Kotlin compared to Java or Scala"</li>
            <li>"Love the energy and interaction with clear explanation"</li>
            <li>"The speakers were good at speaking. The talk itself was well thought out and a great introduction to
                Kotlin.
                It was obvious the guy knew his stuff with the answers he gave to questions. The ability to ask
                questions as we
                went on was very useful."
            </li>
            <li>"I liked the pair programming and live coding aspects of the event. It's really engaging."</li>
            <li>"It was very smoothly executed and good to have someone on keyboard with someone else talking so it
                flowed
                well."
            </li>
            <li>"The presentation was lively and full of personality."</li>
